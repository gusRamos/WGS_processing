##The following commands are used in bash

##first step: md5sum the .gz files
two files at once(forward and reverse) [being in the current directory, otherwise path required]

$ md5sum S4_EDSW200019176-1a_HNKLWDSXY_L1_1.fq.gz S4_EDSW200019176-1a_HNKLWDSXY_L1_2.fq.gz

##second step: use cat to compare the md5sum...gz file with the MD5.txt in order to make sure the file is not corrupted. This
can be checked by comparing the codes below:

$ cat MD5.txt

##third step: checking the quality of the sequences using fastqc before trimming (this command will generate .html outputs for each file.)

$ fastqc S4_EDSW200019176-1a_HNKLWDSXY_L1_1.fq.gz S4_EDSW200019176-1a_HNKLWDSXY_L1_2.fq.gz
